Overview of Eatus the Burgerus App --

In this assignment, I created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and ORM. I followed the MVC design pattern; using Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

Details -- 
- Eatus the Burgerus is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
- Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
- Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
- My app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

What's working -- 
The MVC structure is in place.
Displaying the 3 burgers I started with is working.
The text box for adding a burger is working.
After adding a burger, it shows up in the list of burgers.

What's not added yet --
Ability to add "Not Devoured" burgers.
Updated db from app isn't working.
Styling.
